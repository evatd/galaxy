# interactive-galaxy
A 'star field' visualisation in p5.js.

# How to use
Move your mouse back and forth and explore the galaxy. 

Move forth and you will be taken towards the centre of the galaxy whilst surrounded by streaking stars. Move away from the centre and you will be taken out of the galaxy, which will now resemble a nest of golden stars, as seen from distance.

This builds upon Shiffman's galaxy illusion (Coding Train) - I added the zoom out function, which comes into play alongside the zoom-in function. This is triggered by your mouse moving down the y-axis. Thus, we are able to not only travel through  the galaxy, with streaking stars passing by us. We can too leave the galaxy, with stars becoming tinnier and tinnier golden spots.
