# galaxy
A 'starfield' visualisation in p5.js

### About

Move your mouse back and forth and explore the galaxy. 

This builds upon Shiffman's visualisation (The Coding Train) - I added the zoom out function, which gets triggered as the mouse moves down the y-axis. Thus we can move towards the centre of the galaxy, as well as leave the galaxy, with the stars transforming into tinnier and tinnier golden spots.
