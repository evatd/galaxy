Creative coding | using  p5.js

I create a "star field" visualisation in p5.js.

# How to use
Move your mouse back and fourth, to move towards the centre of the galaxy and out whilst surrounded by streaking stars. Have fun!

This builds upon Shiffman's galaxy illusion (Coding Train) - I added the zoom out function, which comes into play alongside the zoom-in function. This is triggered by your mouse moving down the y-axis. Thus, we are able to not only travel through galaxy, with streaking stars passing by us. We can too leave the galaxy, with stars becoming tinnier and tinnier golden spots.

The files include the pogram for the visualisation in Processing. Created by Daniel Shiffman, these were added for my reference.
